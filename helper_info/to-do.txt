********************* TODO LATER ********************


To upgrade to phaser 3.24.1 (at this point I think I would just do 3.50):
    Have to extrude floor tiles ( at the very least )
    Figure out new input




for our lasers and beams, should I be using a tilesprite?
    So I know how to do it, lets see how ACTUALLY doing it would work

    Need effect_sprites AND effect tilesprites

    An interesting alternative would be to just have a couple of different versions of the normal sprite.
        if displayWidth > 200% texture width, we just use a longer one

    There is also a plugin for stuff like this: https://github.com/nkholski/phaser-animated-tiles




MONSTERS STILL SPAWN TOO SLOW
    Could prioritize spawning of planet_event_linkers that recently had a spawned_event removed


Make it easy for players to exchange ships (buying/selling?)


MasterDJ had tons of emergency pods blocking where his next emergency pod would go, and it caused him to lose his fighter (I assume the emergency pod 
    failed to find a spot, and then it just overwrote his current coord with his new pod)



possibly a more pronouced new message mode on chat. blinking <p>?




protect faction members


    I want a snow effect on the frozen planet!!!!!
        (it's for phaser 2, but I'm sure I can figure out how to do it with phaser 3 https://phaser.io/examples/v2/particles/rain , https://phaser.io/examples/v2/particles/snow )



    Have the diamond batteries spawn on machine planets once we have the Primewall/Glitched God drawn (or find another MLM)


    Test that the basics of factions works


    Sounds for the different damage types
    Background music for the different planets/galaxy



    I really like the idea of a fast/slow growth mode for algae vats... so they make a bunch while you are sleeping
        ALTERNATIVELY, could have them keep producing up to a max storage level

    select objects.id as object_id, objects.player_id, objects.coord_id, coords.object_id, coords.player_id, coords.npc_id,coords.planet_id,coords.belongs_to_planet_id FROM objects LEFT JOIN coords ON coords.id = objects.coord_id WHERE objects.coord_id != false AND objects.object_type_id IN(114,233,298,238,239,339,212,335,369,296,313,381,387) AND objects.player_id != false;



    Research outpost
        Could have an even better benefit than the science vessel. Something that spawns in space. But there's only a couple, and they can be pretty easily 
            salvaged away if not defended

    Addicted to M Man Tick 15/60
        Not sure it's doing much of anything

    maps not updating on autopilot

    acid walls

    Some admin way to view lost things(starting with bodies)



    Test Slerm Armor on Inferno Planet!


    Hacking view
    First thing is a virtual terminal to step into
        Once a player steps into it, 'enter hacking view button' or something
        Continue iterating on this. First step is switching into the view, and back out of the view
            Next is movement

    Doesn't look like the water walls are being damaged on the water ship



    see if I can get someone to make a trailer on fivr

    Make those merchant spots do stuff!
        When spaceporst are built, automatically create two merchant areas and assign them to Cadian
            Same idea with the apartment structure - auto assign areas

            When a market linker ends, if the area has auto_market , just extend it again instead of deleting it.

    laser sound is a pew, laser sprite is a beam
