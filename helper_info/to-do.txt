********************* TODO LATER ********************


To upgrade to phaser 3.24.1:
    Have to extrude floor tiles ( at the very least )
    Figure out new input




for our lasers and beams, should I be using a tilesprite?
    So I know how to do it, lets see how ACTUALLY doing it would work

    Need effect_sprites AND effect tilesprites

    An interesting alternative would be to just have a couple of different versions of the normal sprite.
        if displayWidth > 200% texture width, we just use a longer one

    There is also a plugin for stuff like this: https://github.com/nkholski/phaser-animated-tiles
