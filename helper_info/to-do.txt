********************* TODO LATER ********************


To upgrade to phaser 3.24.1 (at this point I think I would just do 3.50):
    Have to extrude floor tiles ( at the very least )
    Figure out new input




for our lasers and beams, should I be using a tilesprite?
    So I know how to do it, lets see how ACTUALLY doing it would work

    Need effect_sprites AND effect tilesprites

    An interesting alternative would be to just have a couple of different versions of the normal sprite.
        if displayWidth > 200% texture width, we just use a longer one

    There is also a plugin for stuff like this: https://github.com/nkholski/phaser-animated-tiles




MONSTERS STILL SPAWN TOO SLOW
    Could prioritize spawning of planet_event_linkers that recently had a spawned_event removed


Make it easy for players to exchange ships (buying/selling?)


MasterDJ had tons of emergency pods blocking where his next emergency pod would go, and it caused him to lose his fighter (I assume the emergency pod 
    failed to find a spot, and then it just overwrote his current coord with his new pod)



possibly a more pronouced new message mode on chat. blinking <p>?


Notify me when a player logs in?
