NPC spawns with a starter job. Has a chance to pull next job desire. Dream job.
    Every time an NPC gets a job, has a... 10% change to drop back to a previous job tier,
    a 50% chance of wanting to move up, and the rest is just staying that forever.

    or just a job to job linker. Job Z <---> Job A <----> Job B

    Jobs should have structures linked to them

    Jobs have a structure. NPC, once they get a job, they work on getting the requirements for that structure

    Once they have that structure, it should lead them to having enough of something for the next job, if that's what they want
