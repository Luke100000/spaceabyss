So we have a doctor NPC
    The goal: To let the player pay the NPC to perform a surgery on them
    Requirement 1. Player is standing on an auto doc owned by the npc
    Requirement 2. Npc is next to that auto doc
    Price could increase based on npc's surgery level
    Npc's surgery level should increase slowly over time

    So player right clicks on npc, while standing on an auto doc that the npc owns, and that gives the player the option
        to 'Pay to implant xxxx/yyyy'. Similar to the normal auto doc right click menu, but with a $$$ attached to it

Repairman NPC that sits at a spaceport and will buy broken junk off you, repair it, and sell it
    Kind of a side note - but we could have a larger spaceport with more merchant spots for the Azure and Corporation planet
        have lots of space for NPCs and market stalls
        Names for market stalls shown in the client above the spot? "Bob's Repair" for an NPC that repairs named Bob


Could have an artist npc that only produces a couple of art pieces. Could be paintings or a cool neon statue.
    No effect other than being limited. Decorate captains quarters, sign of power.
