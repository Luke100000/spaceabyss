CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:
    Could have a ai_nofitications table that tracks the previous total energy for the AI. Something like every 10 minutes, and if the change is 
        negative, and total energy % is < 50%, send an email

    Still seems like dying from poison doesn't work completely correct. Just watch this

     

DOING NOW:

    Whenever I see a getPlanetCoordIndex, getShipCoordIndex, getCoordIndex, see if it's on a monster,object, or player, and switch it to TYPE.getCoordIndex()

    
    Get some Sokolh for the Asteroid City

    Gotta to something with all the extra asteroids that aren't anywhere
        select COUNT(*) FROM objects WHERE object_type_id = 138 and coord_id is null;
        DELETE FROM objects WHERE object_type_id = 138 and coord_id is null;


    protect faction members


    I want a snow effect on the frozen planet!!!!!
        (it's for phaser 2, but I'm sure I can figure out how to do it with phaser 3 https://phaser.io/examples/v2/particles/rain , https://phaser.io/examples/v2/particles/snow )



    Have the diamond batteries spawn on machine planets once we have the Primewall/Glitched God drawn (or find another MLM)


    Test that the basics of factions works


    Sounds for the different damage types
    Background music for the different planets/galaxy



    I really like the idea of a fast/slow growth mode for algae vats... so they make a bunch while you are sleeping
        ALTERNATIVELY, could have them keep producing up to a max storage level

    select objects.id as object_id, objects.player_id, objects.coord_id, coords.object_id, coords.player_id, coords.npc_id,coords.planet_id,coords.belongs_to_planet_id FROM objects LEFT JOIN coords ON coords.id = objects.coord_id WHERE objects.coord_id != false AND objects.object_type_id IN(114,233,298,238,239,339,212,335,369,296,313,381,387) AND objects.player_id != false;



    Research outpost
        Could have an even better benefit than the science vessel. Something that spawns in space. But there's only a couple, and they can be pretty easily 
            salvaged away if not defended

        Not sure it's doing much of anything

    maps not updating on autopilot

    acid walls

    Some admin way to view lost things(starting with bodies)



    Test Slerm Armor on Inferno Planet!


    Hacking view
    First thing is a virtual terminal to step into
        Once a player steps into it, 'enter hacking view button' or something
        Continue iterating on this. First step is switching into the view, and back out of the view
            Next is movement

    Doesn't look like the water walls are being damaged on the water ship



    see if I can get someone to make a trailer on fivr

    Make those merchant spots do stuff!
        When spaceporst are built, automatically create two merchant areas and assign them to Cadian
            Same idea with the apartment structure - auto assign areas

            When a market linker ends, if the area has auto_market , just extend it again instead of deleting it.
