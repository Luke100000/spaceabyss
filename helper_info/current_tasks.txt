DOING NOW:

    Have thiol extractors suck life out of acid planets



        I think I want to implement both.
            drop_requires_object_type_id for the thiol extractors
                Thiol deposits should show up as events
            drop_requires_floor_type_class for shipyards

        Next:

            When the thiol is spawned, we need the health of the planet to reduce

            planet_type_impact_linkers
                planet_type_id
                object_type_id
                hp_change

            planet_type_hp_linkers ?
                acid planet type -> hp-- whenever a thiol cannister is spawned?
                planet_type_id, object_type_id, hp_change

            For now, we could just have the planet slowly tick/recover hp


            Both require that the thiol extractor can store something
                (ended up just using the spawns object type stuff )
                Current we have max_storage and max_energy_storage
                How about converting those to storage_type and max_storage?


            We currently have
                spawns_object_type_amount
                spawns_id
                spawns_type
                spawns_object_seconds
                has_spawned_object
                spawns_object_type_id
                spawns_object_type_depleted
                spawns_object_type_on_create


    See if we can make it to a warmind
        Can't reasonably get to one with chitin armor set - need exodium set at a minimum I think


    Need to start on augments



    MUST code in safe areas in space. Beacon with an area around it. Beacons needs to be protected by an AI somehow
        Entangled to a particular plantary AI? Or the beacon itself is a AI in SPACE



NEED TO DRAW


    Some slerm. Baby slerm, generic slerm

    Glass of Life Water / Bulb of Life water?
        Drew Kick Bulb. Could do the same with life water
