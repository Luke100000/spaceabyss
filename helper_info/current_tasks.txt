CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:
    Could have a ai_nofitications table that tracks the previous total energy for the AI. Something like every 10 minutes, and if the change is 
        negative, and total energy % is < 50%, send an email

    Still seems like dying from poison doesn't work completely correct. Just watch this

     

DOING NOW:

    Whenever I see a getPlanetCoordIndex, getShipCoordIndex, getCoordIndex, see if it's on a monster,object, or player, and switch it to TYPE.getCoordIndex()



    and work on all this next stuff

    Prison Ship
    1. Find ship image (done)
    2. Some monsters/creatures to put on it
        Warden ( https://images.gemquery.com/262/content_2629483.jpg )
        Guard ( https://images.gemquery.com/257/content_2579086.jpg )
    3. Need a cell door sprite

    Living Rock (find a different name for it?)
        On that topic, lets get some next level bodies
        Human,Mlm, the first ruel one, the acid one



    Trae are still dropping living wood on decay
        Get it to where they drop fragments on decay, living wood on battle

    Crystal is tier 7, but Crystal Spider drops it
        Switch Crystal Spider to dropping
