CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:
    Phatheon creating an AI on the Desert Planet, and then creating a new character to just attack it until it dies


DOING NOW:

    test widden, large ice comet

    While I'm pushing the update, solidify the new build process

    Need to update The Great Nomad, Desert Cruiser Wreck Interior

    Test monsters spawning on ships (could possibly do The Great Nomad, or better to do the Skyscraper I think)
        THIS ALMOST WORKS. THEY JUST KEEP SPAWNING THE MONSTER
        I COULD LEAVE IT LIKE THIS SINCE THE MONSTERS WON'T MOVE UNLESS SOMEONE IS ON THE SHIP
    Once we verify this works, make sure we change all relevant events


    Need to fix dying in a portal ship thing (Corporate Headquarters)

    I should build and test a volt rifle

    large > medium > small goop spawning
        mix of greyframe + creeper world


    possibly a more pronouced new message mode on chat. blinking <p>?

    skyscrapers....
    add in widden image

    seems like kind of a waste to spawn these big buildings full of things, and then to tear them down. Lots of ship coords over time.


        event > despawn_result ? (destory | disappear)

        I could:
        1. Remove from the tile they are on.
        2. Respawn any created at
        3. Use it the next time it spawns 
        (despawn result - disappear or something?)



        Then spawning we would need to check for spawned events matching the event being spawned, and then we can use it
            We could MAYBE use planet_coord_id | ship_coord_id OR if that doesn't work, we can have a is_despawned or something 

    Notify me when a player logs in?



    Have the diamond batteries spawn on machine planets once we have the Primewall/Glitched God drawn (or find another MLM)

    I want to build a garden ship (station)
        It's tier 5 - and none of the tier 5 materials have any organic component. Closest is Living Wood at tier 3.
        Cold Fusion
        Life Blood (don't like the name blood) | Mana | Life Mana | Mako | Lifestream | planet lifestream | gaia



    Test that the basics of factions works
        Maybe a faction display on the site and all that
        have the players attacking Phatheon's stuff be in a faction together
        Cytheus and.... Neurotox
            their faction...
            ChaosArray


    Sounds for the different damage types
    Background music for the different planets/galaxy


    

    I really like the idea of a fast/slow growth mode for algae vats... so they make a bunch while you are sleeping
        ALTERNATIVELY, could have them keep producing up to a max storage level

    select objects.id as object_id, objects.player_id, objects.coord_id, coords.object_id, coords.player_id, coords.npc_id,coords.planet_id,coords.belongs_to_planet_id FROM objects LEFT JOIN coords ON coords.id = objects.coord_id WHERE objects.coord_id != false AND objects.object_type_id IN(114,233,298,238,239,339,212,335,369,296,313,381,387) AND objects.player_id != false;



    Research outpost
        Could have an even better benefit than the science vessel. Something that spawns in space. But there's only a couple, and they can be pretty easily 
            salvaged away if not defended

            Lets start by spawning it with bursters

    Researching augment


    Addicted to M Man Tick 15/60
        Not sure it's doing much of anything

    maps not updating on autopilot

    acid walls

    Some admin way to view lost things(starting with bodies)



    Test Slerm Armor on Inferno Planet!


    Hacking view
    First thing is a virtual terminal to step into
        Once a player steps into it, 'enter hacking view button' or something
        Continue iterating on this. First step is switching into the view, and back out of the view
            Next is movement

    Doesn't look like the water walls are being damaged on the water ship



    see if I can get someone to make a trailer on fivr

    Make those merchant spots do stuff!
        When spaceporst are built, automatically create two merchant areas and assign them to Cadian
            Same idea with the apartment structure - auto assign areas

            When a market linker ends, if the area has auto_market , just extend it again instead of deleting it.

    laser sound is a pew, laser sprite is a beam

    To upgrade to phaser 3.24.1:
        Have to extrude floor tiles ( at the very least )
        Figure out new input
