DOING NOW:

    Testing:
        Have cadian create another ship, and abandon it
        Have Phaethon go into it, and see if the airlock and engine switch over to him

    Gabriel ran out of energy on his engine
        Two big issues: 1 The game did not warn him his engine was low on energy, or how to replenish it
                        2 Need the ion drive to be a converter that can accept batteries
                        3 Need other players to be able to provide energy too

            Not sure about other players providing energy ( the coding of it )
                Focusing now on self refueling and jumping out the airlock


    Airlocks could have rules like doors
        Which means two ships side by side.... other players could move onto the ship if they were allowed



    I really think there are things blocking movement from being nice
        * trying to move while a monster is killed

    Active food replicator from level above showing on layer below
    mining linkers not immediately being removed when switching levels

    Holes being blocked by monsters is kind of awful.
        Either have the player move to another coord around it, or have it push the monsters around

    I want there to be beacons in space that protect an area around them

        So lets say player D is being attacked by player A
        if player D is within range of the beacon, it should protect player D and attack player A


        Lets say beacon at 10,10 is protecting from 8,8 to 12,12

        player D at 12,12 -> Need to find in there is a beacon... anywhere in the vicinity
            hate that

        player D at 12,12 -> coord has a protected_by_object_id field?

        Wouldn't be the worst thing to make the system work for someone to put attacking beacons down too
            ruled_by_object_id ? watched_by_object_id ?

        So how does a defense drone work right now? We just pull it in via the map. Wouldn't have the ability to protect
        AI works at a ship/planet level

        When objects die, we have to check that coords in their room are updated
            Also need to update the watched_by_object_id value if the object isn't found


        For now, we could just have the planet slowly tick/recover hp
            Code it in!



    See if we can make it to a warmind
        Can't reasonably get to one with chitin armor set - need exodium set at a minimum I think


    Need to start on augments



    MUST code in safe areas in space. Beacon with an area around it. Beacons needs to be protected by an AI somehow
        Entangled to a particular plantary AI? Or the beacon itself is a AI in SPACE



NEED TO DRAW


    Some slerm. Baby slerm, generic slerm

    Glass of Life Water / Bulb of Life water?
        Drew Kick Bulb. Could do the same with life water
