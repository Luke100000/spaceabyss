CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:
    Could have a ai_nofitications table that tracks the previous total energy for the AI. Something like every 10 minutes, and if the change is 
        negative, and total energy % is < 50%, send an email

    Still seems like dying from poison doesn't work completely correct. Just watch this

     

DOING NOW:

    Whenever I see a getPlanetCoordIndex, getShipCoordIndex, getCoordIndex, see if it's on a monster,object, or player, and switch it to TYPE.getCoordIndex()


    Poison seems to not update at all, neither damaging you nor disappearing
    The shift key (I wish for a permanent keep-open button) does not keep the windows open when putting an item into the container, it also lags one action behind.


    I wouldn't hate players being able to drive through and explode salvagable stuff

    Poison not going away


    Galaxy coords that players moved through are weird

    Cadian's ship got left in the galaxy. 
        I think maybe this happens when you know it's in the galaxy, and they log off while you are off screen? Or different room? (in ship view?)


    Add in trash asteroid


    Could let players know when their AI kills someone

    "https://space.alphacoders.com/images/plasma-torch.png" has been requested but does not exist (classic 404)
same with "https://space.alphacoders.com/melee.mp3"

    ability to drop onto a stack

    Prison Ship
    1. Find ship image (done)
    2. Some monsters/creatures to put on it
        Warden ( https://images.gemquery.com/262/content_2629483.jpg )
        Guard ( https://images.gemquery.com/257/content_2579086.jpg )
    3. Need a cell door sprite


        Idea for prison ship or something else like it... having monsters spawn trying to take it back

    Living Rock (find a different name for it?)
        On that topic, lets get some next level bodies
        Human,Mlm, the first ruel one, the acid one



    Trae are still dropping living wood on decay
        Get it to where they drop fragments on decay, living wood on battle

    Crystal is tier 7, but Crystal Spider drops it
        Switch Crystal Spider to dropping 


    
    
    Get some Sokolh for the Asteroid City
