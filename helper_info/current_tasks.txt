    select objects.id as object_id, objects.player_id, objects.coord_id, coords.object_id, coords.player_id, coords.npc_id,coords.planet_id,coords.belongs_to_planet_id FROM objects LEFT JOIN coords ON coords.id = objects.coord_id WHERE objects.coord_id != false AND objects.object_type_id IN(114,233,298,238,239,339,212,335,369,296,313,381,387) AND objects.player_id != false;

    See if there are any other disappeared ships
        select ships with a coord_id, left? join coords on the id, select object_id

    1. laser sound
    2. engine sound

    Research outpost
        Could have an even better benefit than the science vessel. Something that spawns in space. But there's only a couple, and they can be pretty easily 
            salvaged away if not defended

    Addicted to M Man Tick 15/60
        Not sure it's doing much of anything

    maps not updating on autopilot

    acid walls

    Some admin way to view lost things(starting with bodies)



    Test Slerm Armor on Inferno Planet!


    Hacking view
    First thing is a virtual terminal to step into
        Once a player steps into it, 'enter hacking view button' or something
        Continue iterating on this. First step is switching into the view, and back out of the view
            Next is movement

    Doesn't look like the water walls are being damaged on the water ship



    see if I can get someone to make a trailer on fivr

    Make those merchant spots do stuff!
        When spaceporst are built, automatically create two merchant areas and assign them to Cadian
            Same idea with the apartment structure - auto assign areas

            When a market linker ends, if the area has auto_market , just extend it again instead of deleting it.
