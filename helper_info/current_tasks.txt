CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:
    Phatheon creating an AI on the Desert Planet, and then creating a new character to just attack it until it dies


DOING NOW:

    Don't increase attack skill when attacking an object type with no attack

    Hacking view
        First thing is a virtual terminal to step into
            Once a player steps into it, 'enter hacking view button' or something
            Continue iterating on this. First step is switching into the view, and back out of the view
                Next is movement


    I keep coming back to The Great Nomad growing things. 


    Work on sending out a newsletter with a google form questionaire. See what people like/dislike so far


    Switch to body could have the option to not transfer your inventory over to the new body. Wouldn't be bad to have 
        that option. Players could fully setup bodies ahead of time.





    See if HP numbers when changing bodies is wacky. It feels wacky.


    see if I can get someone to make a trailer on fivr

    Make those merchant spots do stuff!
        When spaceporst are built, automatically create two merchant areas and assign them to Cadian
            Same idea with the apartment structure - auto assign areas

            When a market linker ends, if the area has auto_market , just extend it again instead of deleting it.



    In Space Abyss You Can....
        BECOME AN OCTOPUS
        SURGICALLY IMPLANT A KNIFE IN YOUR HEAD
        etc

    players have a hard time with tasks. What do I do? I don't want to create a quest system around this - but I would like to offer helpful ideas:

        1. Build and Algae Vat and get Blue Algae from it (But it spawns Algae... not blue Algae? )
        2. Become an Octopus!!
        3. Fully Research Algae and ...
        4. Build a Shuttle
        5. Have a body with two Mimetic Arms


        Implementation Idea #1:
            achievments table (player_id, object_type_id, monster_type_id)
            achievement_linkers table (player_id, achievement id)

        Implementation Idea #2:
            Just have a text list of things on the website.
