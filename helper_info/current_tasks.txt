DOING NOW:




    Need to make sure Gabriel's Space Station has engine and weapon mounts.

            Gabriel's Space Station disappeared when he logged out - things that can be docked at
                need to stay in the game


    Once I'm done with all this I have to test:
        1. Pods moving
        2. Things moving with all, part, 0 engines

    Exodium Knife - requires quick matter knife research

    Thiol Extractor image

    Octopus body and water movement
        I THINK the easiest way to add and apply it is.... an object type property O_o


    Ship tutorial

    
    If we can't place a player in the galaxy, try the coords around the player instead of random
        Search server for: 'Was not able to place player on planet or specific galaxy coord. Getting a random one'
        Players can effectively force a warp

    Need to change move delay server side so players' can't switch to body/ship/body/ship to reset the move delay. Also, probably shouldn't have a 10 move 
        wiggle window for really slow things like stations.


    switch font awesome to self hosted

    autopilot seems to be broken


    make sure crashed meteorites work (salvage them?)

    integrate algae king monster

    advanced forge image and functionality

    draw stimshot/stimpack/whatever


    I need a better way of sending an admin message to everyone about server updates
    
    Client is repeatedly moving too fast!
        I should really try to fix this, make it not happen


    Having multiple ships is not intuitive


    Water planet stuff for Alexander   
        Starfish. Robot shark. Some type of underwater moss? The octopus-like body that is good at cooking is also fast underwater.


        Need to make the octopus body slow on land, fast in water



        Need to limit the # of things that can be stacked on a floor. Limit at 100 Territe/tile or so.


    Not sure that cooking listens to complexity yet


    I want to try and track failed logins, # of logins, etc to see if people are finding the game and leaving,
        finding the game and failing to login, finding the game and then just.... dying?


    Need to expand on augments

    admin /moveto ship is buggy!!!


    Make those merchant spots do stuff!

    Have a derelict spaceship type that spawns as an event in the galaxy. Comes with multiple levels, and monsters spawn on it.
        and it's salvagable, and there is salvage contained within

    I should do a pass on some of the basic things players get to do as well, and try making videos for some of
        them on Youtube
        Traps - I need to expand on this
        Mining - I definitely want things like exodium and gold be to able to be mined from asteroids.
            I either want asteroids to have a pre-determined composition, or I want to dynamically pull chances
            for things based on the mining tools used, and the skill.

            Have asteroids move slowly through space?
                If an asteroid landed on a planet, would spawn a crashed meteorite or something I guess.

    No 'set autopilot destination' option for large dockable ships. It would be good to see why that isn't showing up.
        Same with switching to. I think it has to do with the belongs_to coords

    If a ship is dockable, we want to run the sprite all the time


        The ability to re-generate a single level


NEED TO DRAW


    Some slerm. Baby slerm, generic slerm

    Glass of Life Water / Bulb of Life water?
        Drew Kick Bulb. Could do the same with life water
