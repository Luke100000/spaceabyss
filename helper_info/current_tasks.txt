OTHER ALPHA CODERS THINGS I NEED TO REMEMBER
https://pics.alphacoders.com/pictures/edit/413163
Change some wording on add info page for non-trusted users

CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:



DOING NOW:


    change world.insertObjectType to return the object index instead of the ID
        and all functions that use it to follow this


    JUST GOTTA TEST THIS NOW
    Could have a ai_nofitications table that tracks the previous total energy for the AI. Something like every 10 minutes, and if the change is 
        negative, and total energy % is < 50%, send an email

    Really need that in-game message system
    
    
    
    Maybe in the tutorial explain how we aren't going to have 2x experience events, holiday events, etc.
        Things like that, imo, break the feel of the universe I'm trying to build. 

    Maybe change the Loading.... thing to not let people enter their information until after it's 
        gone away, force refresh the page if it's taking a while? HMMMMM.


    One of the things that STEIN WORLD and Mystera Legacy do well is a good initial login page.
        Custom look - a song that loads in.... it's pleasant.




    

    Add in a banned message, and reasoning and such

    Recover lost item interface (masterdj and his fighter)
        Combine this with a private message system?
        
        Maybe separate. I had the idea of a private message tab in chat that would open all of a player's private chats

    Still seems like dying from poison doesn't work completely correct. Just watch this

    make sure editing factions works

    

    MONSTERS STILL SPAWN TOO SLOW
        Could prioritize spawning of planet_event_linkers that recently had a spawned_event removed



    community feature - report - and potentially ban a player ( ban for name, spamming chat, other things I suppose )

    Game isn't saying that the machine planet is under attack

    go through out getPlanetCoordIndex calls and see where we can switch things to use the neighbor system

    Make it easy for players to exchange ships (buying/selling?)


    MasterDJ had tons of emergency pods blocking where his next emergency pod would go, and it caused him to lose his fighter (I assume the emergency pod 
        failed to find a spot, and then it just overwrote his current coord with his new pod)


    protect faction members

    research body not being able to be picked up? Not sure if I meant for that to be intentional or not with bodies


    I can warp ships to 
    I've been thinking of having the spaceport 


    large > medium > small goop spawning
        mix of greyframe + creeper world

        Have them mostly coded - mostly just need the images.


    possibly a more pronouced new message mode on chat. blinking <p>?


    Notify me when a player logs in?

    I want a snow effect on the frozen planet!!!!!
        (it's for phaser 2, but I'm sure I can figure out how to do it with phaser 3 https://phaser.io/examples/v2/particles/rain , https://phaser.io/examples/v2/particles/snow )



    Have the diamond batteries spawn on machine planets once we have the Primewall/Glitched God drawn (or find another MLM)




    Test that the basics of factions works
        Maybe a faction display on the site and all that
        have the players attacking Phatheon's stuff be in a faction together
        Cytheus and.... Neurotox
            their faction...
            ChaosArray


    Sounds for the different damage types
    Background music for the different planets/galaxy

    no large ice comets!
        They were instantly turning into 100 ice
        Re-check on this around mid January
    

    I really like the idea of a fast/slow growth mode for algae vats... so they make a bunch while you are sleeping
        ALTERNATIVELY, could have them keep producing up to a max storage level

    select objects.id as object_id, objects.player_id, objects.coord_id, coords.object_id, coords.player_id, coords.npc_id,coords.planet_id,coords.belongs_to_planet_id FROM objects LEFT JOIN coords ON coords.id = objects.coord_id WHERE objects.coord_id != false AND objects.object_type_id IN(114,233,298,238,239,339,212,335,369,296,313,381,387) AND objects.player_id != false;



    Research outpost
        Could have an even better benefit than the science vessel. Something that spawns in space. But there's only a couple, and they can be pretty easily 
            salvaged away if not defended
        Research Outpost Content
            Lets start by spawning it with bursters

    data breach content

    Researching augment


    Addicted to M Man Tick 15/60
        Not sure it's doing much of anything

    maps not updating on autopilot

    acid walls

    Some admin way to view lost things(starting with bodies)



    Test Slerm Armor on Inferno Planet!


    Hacking view
    First thing is a virtual terminal to step into
        Once a player steps into it, 'enter hacking view button' or something
        Continue iterating on this. First step is switching into the view, and back out of the view
            Next is movement

    Doesn't look like the water walls are being damaged on the water ship



    see if I can get someone to make a trailer on fivr


    Explore more indie mmos, and marketing paths

    Make those merchant spots do stuff!
        When spaceporst are built, automatically create two merchant areas and assign them to Cadian
            Same idea with the apartment structure - auto assign areas

            When a market linker ends, if the area has auto_market , just extend it again instead of deleting it.

    laser sound is a pew, laser sprite is a beam
