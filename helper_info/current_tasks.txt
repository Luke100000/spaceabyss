DOING NOW:


    players have a hard time with tasks. What do I do? I don't want to create a quest system around this - but I would like to offer helpful ideas:

        1. Build and Algae Vat and get Blue Algae from it (But it spawns Algae... not blue Algae? )
        2. Build an Octopus Body
        3. Fully Research Algae and 

    

    should do the same thing with a moveobjectto type of command for that dead body issue
        along these lines, maybe have an admin page for 'lost' objects, monsters, etc


    Ocotopus body needs consumables

    see if I can get someone to make a trailer on fivr


    Explore more indie mmos, and marketing paths

    Make those merchant spots do stuff!
        When spaceporst are built, automatically create two merchant areas and assign them to Cadian
            Same idea with the apartment structure - auto assign areas

            When a market linker ends, if the area has auto_market , just extend it again instead of deleting it.
