DOING NOW:



    So an algae vat on your ship taking 2 hours to produce an algae is.... butt. It's way too long.
        See if there's other things that I would want to take that long - or otherwise drop it down SIGNIFICANTLY to like 10 minutes.

        Decay ticking on the algae vat every 10 minutes is too much too. How long should it take for an algae vat in a spaceship to decay in IRL time?
            Honestly like 5 days to a week or something.

            So lets balance that out - re-add in the ship dirt tile, and give it something like a 'growing medium' floor type class, or something like that.

            I also need the kick plant to be smaller




    I think the left movement showing the right animation has something to do with switching ships.


    object type have max_storage, and a newer, more clear, max_energy_storage
        Look up all object types that use either of these, and make sure they are using the correct one

        I like the idea of giving these things a not full/full frame.
            is_full boolean?


        While doing this, rename object_types.frame_count to object_types.is_active_frame_count
        and add a is_full_game_file_index 
    energy storage should show the amount of energy by default when clicked on

    integrate new algae vat with the increased number of frames

    integrate algae king monster

    draw stimshot/stimpack/whatever


    Water planet stuff for Alexander   
        Starfish. Robot shark. Some type of underwater moss? The octopus-like body that is good at cooking is also fast underwater.


        Need to make the octopus body slow on land, fast in water

    Investigate why monsters show up on the wrong tile sometimes
        It looks like this is usually occuring when we switch levels


        Need to limit the # of things that can be stacked on a floor. Limit at 100 Territe/tile or so.



    I want to try and track failed logins, # of logins, etc to see if people are finding the game and leaving,
        finding the game and failing to login, finding the game and then just.... dying?


    Need to expand on augments


    Make those merchant spots do stuff!

    Have a derelict spaceship type that spawns as an event in the galaxy. Comes with multiple levels, and monsters spawn on it.
        and it's salvagable, and there is salvage contained within

    I should do a pass on some of the basic things players get to do as well, and try making videos for some of
        them on Youtube
        Traps - I need to expand on this
        Mining - I definitely want things like exodium and gold be to able to be mined from asteroids.
            I either want asteroids to have a pre-determined composition, or I want to dynamically pull chances
            for things based on the mining tools used, and the skill.

            Have asteroids move slowly through space?
                If an asteroid landed on a planet, would spawn a crashed meteorite or something I guess.

    No 'set autopilot destination' option for large dockable ships. It would be good to see why that isn't showing up.
        Same with switching to. I think it has to do with the belongs_to coords

    If a ship is dockable, we want to run the sprite all the time


        The ability to re-generate a single level


NEED TO DRAW


    Some slerm. Baby slerm, generic slerm

    Glass of Life Water / Bulb of Life water?
        Drew Kick Bulb. Could do the same with life water
