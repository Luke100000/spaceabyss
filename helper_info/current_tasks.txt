DOING NOW:


    Kick plants not harvesting right

    Make ice blocks weak to heat


    I want things like a life herb cluster to be easier to grow if someone is a good farmer.
        Could have a player skill linked to specific spawn linkers
        I could also just put the max HP for negative things at 100% hp, and then if a farmer gives life water to stuff
            and get HP > 100%, the bad option goes away.


    check things like asteroids that spawn on create


    Gotta make sure we harvest the right thing when we harvest from something with multiple spawn options




    Want to go over the example of a life herb seedling turning into a monster while in inventory
        Have the monster just spawn adjacent to the player?

    Examples I want to make fit

        Small Ice Block takes a long time, multiple ticks, to turn into an Ice Block

        Algae Vat spawning normal algae, and spawning super good algae

        Matriarch Spawning Eggs, special eggs, and having an attack chance

        STILL HAVE DROP LINKER TABLE

        create table spawn_linkers(id int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
            monster_type_id int,
            object_type_id int,
            rarity int,
            ticks_required int,
            spawns_object_type_id int,
            spawns_monster_type_id int,
            spawns_amount int,
            spawns_location varchar(20),
            spawns_on_create boolean default false,
            minimum_hp_percent int,
            maximum_hp_percent int,
            created_at datetime,
            updated_at datetime);


            Parts to maybe keep in the object_types table:
                spawns_object_type_depleted
                has_spawned_object

            Parts to maybe keep in the monster_types table:
                attack_chance_on_harvest
                spawns_object_type_depleted

            Parts to maybe keep in objects table:
                has_spawned_object

            Parts to maybe keep in monsters table:
                has_spawned_object


        EXAMPLES:
            Milk Slerm:
                Monster Table:
                    spawns_object_type_depleted: ded

                Change Linker Table:
                    spawns_object_type_id -> Slerm Milk
                    spawns_amount -> 2
                    spawns_location -> has_spawned_object

            Matriarch:
                Monster Types Table:
                    attack_chance_on_harvest -> 30%... doesn't apply in the egg scenario I guess. Unless it could spawn some 'in it'

                Change Linker Table:
                    spawns_object_type_id -> Voon Egg
                    spawns_amount -> 1
                    spawns_location -> adjacent


            Small Ice Block
                Objects Table:
                Change Linker Table:
                    spawns_object_type_id -> Ice Block
                    ticks_required -> a lot
                    spawns_location -> self

            Algae Vat
                Objects Table:
                Change Linker Table:
                    spawns_object_type_id -> Algae
                    rarity -> common
                    spawns_amount -> 2
                    spawns_location -> has_spawned_object

                    spawns_object_type_id -> Blue Algae
                    rarity -> rare
                    spawns_amount -> 2
                    spawns_location -> has_spawned_object
                    minimum_hp_percent -> 100
                    maximum_hp_percent -> 1000


            I THINK IT WILL WORK. SO LETS JUST ADD THIS NEW WAY IN

    Allow grows_into_object_type_id to take an amount of ticks
        Should I break it into its own table?
            grows_into_object_type_id
            Could have different grows into things with different chances
            ticks_required, etc

            Trae could 90% chance grow into a normal one, or 10% chance grow into a special one. That type of thing.

            I FEEL like this is similar to something I've already done. I don't want to re-code. Find out what it is that
            feels so similar. Algae vats?



    MONSTERS IN SPACE!

    THE BOYS WANT MILK SLERMS TO DROP STUFF!
        I think it would be neat if there was the option to just take some of what something spawned
        With the Milk Slerm, you could take one or two, and it could generate more, but if you took all,
            it would de-spawn.


    Slime berry tree should have a sprite
    Shuttle should have a sprite


    Make it so that a planet's HP is viewable, and have the HP tick

    Lets work on adding in factions




    I want to try and track failed logins, # of logins, etc to see if people are finding the game and leaving,
        finding the game and failing to login, finding the game and then just.... dying?


    See if we can make it to a warmind
        Can't reasonably get to one with chitin armor set - need exodium set at a minimum I think


    Need to expand on augments


    Make those merchant spots do stuff!

    Have a derelict spaceship type that spawns as an event in the galaxy. Comes with multiple levels, and monsters spawn on it.
        and it's salvagable, and there is salvage contained within

    I should do a pass on some of the basic things players get to do as well, and try making videos for some of
        them on Youtube
        Traps - I need to expand on this
        Mining - I definitely want things like exodium and gold be to able to be mined from asteroids.
            I either want asteroids to have a pre-determined composition, or I want to dynamically pull chances
            for things based on the mining tools used, and the skill.

            Have asteroids move slowly through space?
                If an asteroid landed on a planet, would spawn a crashed meteorite or something I guess.

    No 'set autopilot destination' option for large dockable ships. It would be good to see why that isn't showing up.
        Same with switching to. I think it has to do with the belongs_to coords

    If a ship is dockable, we want to run the sprite all the time

        The ability to add in a spawn without re-generating the entire level
        The ability to re-generate a single level

NEED TO DRAW


    Some slerm. Baby slerm, generic slerm

    Glass of Life Water / Bulb of Life water?
        Drew Kick Bulb. Could do the same with life water

THINGS TO INVESTIGATE/OPTIMIZATION IDEAS:
    /addinventory 100 manufacturing augment
        The above admin command lags up the client to the point of disconnect. Need to figure out why,
        and if it's just the one client, or the entire server.

    I had the idea of not storing planet coords at level -1 and below if they are just walls - and telling the client
        to just draw those spaces as walls.
        Benefits: Many less planet coords
        Cons: Each time the server fails to find a planet coord, it means a full array lookup
        (and potentially a database query, which also ends up not finding it). Quite a few things to consider
        to avoid some big drawbacks.


    Another idea is to store the array index of things in memory, so we don't have to do lookups all the time
        e.g. Storing that planet_coord id: 70 has array index: 30
        If done well, I think I could avoid a lot of lookups, and I believe the only big con is more memory usage

    Third idea for planet coords is to separate them out by planet
    dirty.planet_coords[planet_id] = []; //?
