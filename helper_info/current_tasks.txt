CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:
    Phatheon creating an AI on the Desert Planet, and then creating a new character to just attack it until it dies


DOING NOW:


    Still seems like dying from poison doesn't work completely correct. Just watch this

    make sure editing factions works
    

    MONSTERS STILL SPAWN TOO SLOW
        Could prioritize spawning of planet_event_linkers that recently had a spawned_event removed

    fighter costs 5 refined territe, but up to 199 refined territe to repair....
        It's fine if it's more expensive... .but not THAT MUCH. Holy poop
        and add to tutorial
        repairing is funky if it hits a wall


    community feature - report - and potentially ban a player ( ban for name, spamming chat, other things I suppose )

    Game isn't saying that the machine planet is under attack

    go through out getPlanetCoordIndex calls and see where we can switch things to use the neighbor system

    Make it easy for players to exchange ships (buying/selling?)

    explain ai more  each part


    protect faction members

    research body not being able to be picked up? Not sure if I meant for that to be intentional or not with bodies


    large > medium > small goop spawning
        mix of greyframe + creeper world

        Have them mostly coded - mostly just need the images.


    possibly a more pronouced new message mode on chat. blinking <p>?


    Notify me when a player logs in?

    I want a snow effect on the frozen planet!!!!!
        (it's for phaser 2, but I'm sure I can figure out how to do it with phaser 3 https://phaser.io/examples/v2/particles/rain , https://phaser.io/examples/v2/particles/snow )



    Have the diamond batteries spawn on machine planets once we have the Primewall/Glitched God drawn (or find another MLM)




    Test that the basics of factions works
        Maybe a faction display on the site and all that
        have the players attacking Phatheon's stuff be in a faction together
        Cytheus and.... Neurotox
            their faction...
            ChaosArray


    Sounds for the different damage types
    Background music for the different planets/galaxy

    no large ice comets!
        They were instantly turning into 100 ice
        Re-check on this around mid January
    

    I really like the idea of a fast/slow growth mode for algae vats... so they make a bunch while you are sleeping
        ALTERNATIVELY, could have them keep producing up to a max storage level

    select objects.id as object_id, objects.player_id, objects.coord_id, coords.object_id, coords.player_id, coords.npc_id,coords.planet_id,coords.belongs_to_planet_id FROM objects LEFT JOIN coords ON coords.id = objects.coord_id WHERE objects.coord_id != false AND objects.object_type_id IN(114,233,298,238,239,339,212,335,369,296,313,381,387) AND objects.player_id != false;



    Research outpost
        Could have an even better benefit than the science vessel. Something that spawns in space. But there's only a couple, and they can be pretty easily 
            salvaged away if not defended
        Research Outpost Content
            Lets start by spawning it with bursters

    Researching augment


    Addicted to M Man Tick 15/60
        Not sure it's doing much of anything

    maps not updating on autopilot

    acid walls

    Some admin way to view lost things(starting with bodies)



    Test Slerm Armor on Inferno Planet!


    Hacking view
    First thing is a virtual terminal to step into
        Once a player steps into it, 'enter hacking view button' or something
        Continue iterating on this. First step is switching into the view, and back out of the view
            Next is movement

    Doesn't look like the water walls are being damaged on the water ship



    see if I can get someone to make a trailer on fivr

    Make those merchant spots do stuff!
        When spaceporst are built, automatically create two merchant areas and assign them to Cadian
            Same idea with the apartment structure - auto assign areas

            When a market linker ends, if the area has auto_market , just extend it again instead of deleting it.
