CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:
    Phatheon creating an AI on the Desert Planet, and then creating a new character to just attack it until it dies


DOING NOW:



    Research outpost
        Could have an even better benefit than the science vessel. Something that spawns in space. But there's only a couple, and they can be pretty easily 
            salvaged away if not defended

            Next is movement
