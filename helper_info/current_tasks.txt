CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:
    Phatheon creating an AI on the Desert Planet, and then creating a new character to just attack it until it dies


DOING NOW:



    Could have a monster looking portal (still an object type) as an event. Basically make a portal, but it looks like a huge monster mouth. Transports you to 'inside the monster' (Could just be a ship in the code )
    To add this we would need an is_portal attribute on OBJECT TYPES so there are multiple possible portals.

    Would spawn a ship, and we would just not add that ship to any coords. Things like this would probably be at risk of being deleted
        at some point, so would add another attribute to object types can_be_nowhere. I suppose :p This would also work for the great ship.
        Stuff like: https://images.gemquery.com/254/content_2549852.jpg for the object type. 2x2 tiles.

    So the actual steps:
        1. Spawn a ship, don't add it to any coord. The ship should have a portal on it somewhere.
        2. Spawn another portal somewhere on a planet. Make sure they are linked. Some neat event space now!


    I keep coming back to The Great Nomad growing things. 


    Did a stupid and added the BURSTER as a monster BUSTER. Switch all BUSTER to BURSTER


    Hacking view
    First thing is a virtual terminal to step into
        Once a player steps into it, 'enter hacking view button' or something
        Continue iterating on this. First step is switching into the view, and back out of the view
            Next is movement

    Doesn't look like the water walls are being damaged on the water ship


    Work on sending out a newsletter with a google form questionaire. See what people like/dislike so far


    Switch to body could have the option to not transfer your inventory over to the new body. Wouldn't be bad to have 
        that option. Players could fully setup bodies ahead of time.


    See if HP numbers when changing bodies is wacky. It feels wacky.


    see if I can get someone to make a trailer on fivr

    Make those merchant spots do stuff!
        When spaceporst are built, automatically create two merchant areas and assign them to Cadian
            Same idea with the apartment structure - auto assign areas

            When a market linker ends, if the area has auto_market , just extend it again instead of deleting it.



    In Space Abyss You Can....
        BECOME AN OCTOPUS

        etc

    players have a hard time with tasks. What do I do? I don't want to create a quest system around this - but I would like to offer helpful ideas:

        1. Build and Algae Vat and get Blue Algae from it (But it spawns Algae... not blue Algae? )
        2. Become an Octopus!!
        3. Fully Research Algae and ...
        4. Build a Shuttle
        5. Have a body with two Mimetic Arms


        Implementation Idea #1:
            achievments table (player_id, object_type_id, monster_type_id)
            achievement_linkers table (player_id, achievement id)

        Implementation Idea #2:
            Just have a text list of things on the website.
