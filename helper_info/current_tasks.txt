DOING NOW:


    Lets work on adding in factions
    Should be able to put batteries into AI Batteries (is_converter thing)
        TEST THIS


    For now, we could just have the planet slowly tick/recover hp
        Code it in!


    See if we can make it to a warmind
        Can't reasonably get to one with chitin armor set - need exodium set at a minimum I think


    Need to expand on augments

    I should invest time in making the designing of ships easier. Like admins can draw floor tiles in space.
    Also should make our station multi level - adding in support for that (big task!)
        CURRENT: Currently I am going through getShipCoordIndex, and I need to also do the map stuff.
        Maybe search by planet coord level instances in the code or something too


    Make those merchant spots do stuff!

    Have a derelict spaceship type that spawns as an event in the galaxy. Comes with multiple levels, and monsters spawn on it.
        and it's salvagable, and there is salvage contained within


NEED TO DRAW


    Some slerm. Baby slerm, generic slerm

    Glass of Life Water / Bulb of Life water?
        Drew Kick Bulb. Could do the same with life water

THINGS TO INVESTIGATE/OPTIMIZATION IDEAS:
    /addinventory 100 manufacturing augment
        The above admin command lags up the client to the point of disconnect. Need to figure out why,
        and if it's just the one client, or the entire server.

    I had the idea of not storing planet coords at level -1 and below if they are just walls - and telling the client
        to just draw those spaces as walls.
        Benefits: Many less planet coords
        Cons: Each time the server fails to find a planet coord, it means a full array lookup
        (and potentially a database query, which also ends up not finding it). Quite a few things to consider
        to avoid some big drawbacks.


    Another idea is to store the array index of things in memory, so we don't have to do lookups all the time
        e.g. Storing that planet_coord id: 70 has array index: 30
        If done well, I think I could avoid a lot of lookups, and I believe the only big con is more memory usage

    Third idea for planet coords is to separate them out by planet
    dirty.planet_coords[planet_id] = []; //?
