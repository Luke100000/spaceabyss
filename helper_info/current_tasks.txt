DOING NOW NOW game.deleteSpawnedEvent - dropping things from multiple tiles


    If a ship is dockable, we want to run the sprite all the time

    No 'set autopilot destination' option for large dockable ships. It would be good to see why that isn't showing up.
        Same with switching to. I think it has to do with the belongs_to coords

    Lets work on adding in factions
    Should be able to put batteries into AI Batteries (is_converter thing)
        TEST THIS


    For now, we could just have the planet slowly tick/recover hp
        Code it in!


    See if we can make it to a warmind
        Can't reasonably get to one with chitin armor set - need exodium set at a minimum I think


    Need to expand on augments


    Make those merchant spots do stuff!

    Have a derelict spaceship type that spawns as an event in the galaxy. Comes with multiple levels, and monsters spawn on it.
        and it's salvagable, and there is salvage contained within

    I should do a pass on some of the basic things players get to do as well, and try making videos for some of
        them on Youtube
        Traps - I need to expand on this
        Mining - I definitely want things like exodium and gold be to able to be mined from asteroids.
            I either want asteroids to have a pre-determined composition, or I want to dynamically pull chances
            for things based on the mining tools used, and the skill.

            Have asteroids move slowly through space?
                If an asteroid landed on a planet, would spawn a crashed meteorite or something I guess.


NEED TO DRAW


    Some slerm. Baby slerm, generic slerm

        Drew Kick Bulb. Could do the same with life water

THINGS TO INVESTIGATE/OPTIMIZATION IDEAS:
    /addinventory 100 manufacturing augment
        The above admin command lags up the client to the point of disconnect. Need to figure out why,
        and if it's just the one client, or the entire server.

    I had the idea of not storing planet coords at level -1 and below if they are just walls - and telling the client
        to just draw those spaces as walls.
        Benefits: Many less planet coords
        Cons: Each time the server fails to find a planet coord, it means a full array lookup
        (and potentially a database query, which also ends up not finding it). Quite a few things to consider
        to avoid some big drawbacks.


    Another idea is to store the array index of things in memory, so we don't have to do lookups all the time
        e.g. Storing that planet_coord id: 70 has array index: 30
        If done well, I think I could avoid a lot of lookups, and I believe the only big con is more memory usage

    Third idea for planet coords is to separate them out by planet
    dirty.planet_coords[planet_id] = []; //?
