CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:
    Phatheon creating an AI on the Desert Planet, and then creating a new character to just attack it until it dies


DOING NOW:

    Make sure the desert cruiser wreck shows up properly

    The updated portal system is a mess at the moment. 

        1. Need a portal that is the image of the wreck/mouth etc
        2. Need an exit portal that can be different image/object type
        3. Need the interior (spawning a ship)

        So for our Desert Cruiser Wreck we need:
            1. Portal Object Type called Desert Cruiser Wreck
            2. Portal Object Type called Desert Cruiser Wreck Exit
            3. Ship Object Type called Desert Cruiser Wreck Interior
            
            4. Event called Desert Cruiser Wreck.




    Hacking view
    First thing is a virtual terminal to step into
        Once a player steps into it, 'enter hacking view button' or something
        Continue iterating on this. First step is switching into the view, and back out of the view
            Next is movement

    Doesn't look like the water walls are being damaged on the water ship

    Switch to body could have the option to not transfer your inventory over to the new body. Wouldn't be bad to have 
        that option. Players could fully setup bodies ahead of time.

    Make those merchant spots do stuff!
        When spaceporst are built, automatically create two merchant areas and assign them to Cadian
            Same idea with the apartment structure - auto assign areas

            When a market linker ends, if the area has auto_market , just extend it again instead of deleting it.



    In Space Abyss You Can....
        BECOME AN OCTOPUS
        SURGICALLY IMPLANT A KNIFE IN YOUR HEAD
        etc

    players have a hard time with tasks. What do I do? I don't want to create a quest system around this - but I would like to offer helpful ideas:

        1. Build and Algae Vat and get Blue Algae from it (But it spawns Algae... not blue Algae? )
        2. Become an Octopus!!
        3. Fully Research Algae and ...
        4. Build a Shuttle
        5. Have a body with two Mimetic Arms


        Implementation Idea #1:
            achievments table (player_id, object_type_id, monster_type_id)
            achievement_linkers table (player_id, achievement id)

        Implementation Idea #2:
            Just have a text list of things on the website. 

        Could let the player give themselves tasks too

        'obtain 10 batteries'
