** THINGS I'M SENDING FERNANDO'S WAY **
***************************************

Notes on 1-3: These are all part of the same race. Sokolh. I want to focus on white/clean designs. 
These are lower tier monsters, so they can be a little dirtier than some of the high level ones. You can see all my 
stored references for Sokolh at https://gemquery.com/favorite/by-tag/97648 

Not all reference images are exact, but the focus is on WHITE. Purity. The Sokolh think they are better than everyone. Purer. Smarter. Gold accents tend to highlight this.

1. Discarded Lancer
Type: Monster
Frames Neede: 1-2 Designs
Size: 32x32 max
Attacks: Lance Stab
Description: A Sokolh marred with imperfections. They battle in hopes that cleaning the world of others could one day cleanse them.
Reference Image: https://images.gemquery.com/259/content_2594269.jpg


2. Servant
Type: Monster
Size: 32x42 max
Frames Needed: 1-2 Designs
Attacks: Defensive Matrix (hacking damage, ranged attack)
Description: Serves higher level Sokolh with absolute perfection
Reference Image: https://images.gemquery.com/260/content_2607437.jpg


3. Infantry
Type: Monster
Frames Needed: 1-2 Designs
Size: 32x46 max
Attacks: Piercing. I'd like to focus on the pointy arm. I envision it mimetic - being able to change shapes (grow longer to stab)
Description: Lower tier, but still respected, in Sokolh society. Their basic infantry are always training to advance to something more.
Reference Image: https://images.gemquery.com/259/content_2599155.jpg
Notes: The reference image has WAS too much gold on it. I want the focus to be the white.


4. Beetle Knight

Rain Floor
Type: Animated Floor/Weather Effect
Frames Needed:
    32x32 base floor tile - animated (4-6 frames)
    32x64 (see notes) rain + cloud that shows above players - animated (4-6 frames - needs to match frame count of base floor tile)

Notes: The goal is for it to look good as a single tile and when it's in a grid. The 32x32 base floor tile needs to be exact, but the 32x64 rain + cloud can 
be taller/wider if it can help the look. It just shouldn't look like it's raining on adjacent tiles. 
I've attached an example of what it currently looks like in testing

Lava Flow Floor

** THINGS I'M SENDING DIOPHAMTO'S WAY **
