Plasma Cell Deposit

Gaian Plasma Deposit
Type: Spawner
Frames Needed: 1 empty frame, one full frame
Current Sprite: https://space.alphacoders.com/images/gaian-plasma-deposit-all.png
Flavor Text: A vein of some special part of a Biogrove Planet. The life energy eminating from it is immense.

Diamond Battery Deposit
Type: Spawner
Size: 30x30 max

Notes: Spawns several of the Diamond Batteries that we drew in batch #24 (https://space.alphacoders.com/images/diamond-battery.png) I don't have an image for it,
but a lower tier spawner ( it spawns normal batteries ) is https://space.alphacoders.com/images/battery-deposit-animated.png for example.

** THINGS I'M SENDING FERNANDO'S WAY **
***************************************


Keratin
Size: 18x18 max
Frames Needed: 1 design
Notes: We did a Keratin armor set in batch #24. I need just a small sprite of a piece of Keratin. 

Beetle Knight

Voon Mech

Nulrom Beacon

Growing Abomination

Voon Vial

Nulrom Egg Sack

Rain Floor
Type: Animated Floor/Weather Effect
Frames Needed:
    32x32 base floor tile - animated (4-6 frames)
    32x64 (see notes) rain + cloud that shows above players - animated (4-6 frames - needs to match frame count of base floor tile)

Notes: The goal is for it to look good as a single tile and when it's in a grid. The 32x32 base floor tile needs to be exact, but the 32x64 rain + cloud can 
be taller/wider if it can help the look. It just shouldn't look like it's raining on adjacent tiles. 
I've attached an example of what it currently looks like in testing


Snowstorm Floor


Lava Flow Floor
