Light Sail Ship (Lighthugger?)
Ramscoops. There is stuff in space. In the 'interstellar medium'. Would be neat to have ships
    slowly accrue some material if they are a certain type of ship

Pinnace (Don't like how it sounds verbally. PENIS)
Starliner
Diligent-class tactical patrol/escort ship 

lets do the same with salvaging and surgery (salvaging ship, hospital ships)
Homestead ship
Generation ship
Starship
Transport ship
Yacht
Gundam style spaceship for players
Gunship


ENGINE TYPES

    I think I like the idea of having most engine types having specific fuel types that they excell with,
        but I like the idea of turning things like algae into fuel. So letting algae get turned into an algae cell and
        be inputted into a fusion/thiol/drive

Hidden/None
Pod
    Ion Drive

        Algae
        Electric - Batteries
        Fusion - Water


            Thiol

            Mass Converter (Just put whatever in it!)

                Power Cells (Fuel Cells?)
                Fusion - Life Water (This is gonna be really limited...)

                Living Wood drive - can add life water, or just wait for regen



                                        Antimatter
