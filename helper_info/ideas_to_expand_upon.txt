Traps - I need to expand on this


Think of content for Jovian planets and the moons around them

Think of content for traps



Objects that get better with age. Kind of like wine. Kids were watching a show and they ate 1,000 year old eggs.


The Story of Space Abyss

    Love the story that Rimworld generates. Love the story that Eve Online generates. I want Space Abyss to tell it's story.

    I'm not actually sure I want to generate logs for each kill, at least as a start.
        create a combat/event log when a monster is killed by a player

    Things like The Great Nomad entering/exiting the galaxy, taking over planets/ships, bug attack events + who kills them are probably the priority. 

    Storyteller using planet health, time to eradicate, etc for scaling
