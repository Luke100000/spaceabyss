******************THINGS TO INVESTIGATE/OPTIMIZATION IDEAS******************:
    /addinventory 100 manufacturing augment
        The above admin command lags up the client to the point of disconnect. Need to figure out why,
        and if it's just the one client, or the entire server.

    I had the idea of not storing planet coords at level -1 and below if they are just walls - and telling the client
        to just draw those spaces as walls.
        Benefits: Many less planet coords
        Cons: Each time the server fails to find a planet coord, it means a full array lookup
        (and potentially a database query, which also ends up not finding it). Quite a few things to consider
        to avoid some big drawbacks.


    Another idea is to store the array index of things in memory, so we don't have to do lookups all the time
        e.g. Storing that planet_coord id: 70 has array index: 30
        If done well, I think I could avoid a lot of lookups, and I believe the only big con is more memory usage

    Third idea for planet coords is to separate them out by planet
    dirty.planet_coords[planet_id] = []; //?



    See if we can make the right side of space abyss scroll so the left side doesn't move around

    
    Lets see if we can switching logging in to asynchronous.

    
    have the health page send a warning email if the levels of certain things are too low


************************ UNSORTED IDEAS *****************************:



So I have all these error messages - and they come then go really fast. Maybe I could have a generic help button that popped up 
    the click menu, or another popup-ish window, and gave further explanation about the latest failure messages.
    No ship floor space, gives a link to the tutorial, and briefly says that 'Bulk containers (picture) and ice containers (picture) 
    can be used so the results of mining aren't just thrown all over the floor.


Maybe turn Slime Berry Tree into Slerm Berry Tree - and make the berries into Slerm Berries, which maybe grow into
    a different type of slerm if they are dropped on like a ship or corporation world.



So we have a doctor NPC
    The goal: To let the player pay the NPC to perform a surgery on them
    Requirement 1. Player is standing on an auto doc owned by the npc
    Requirement 2. Npc is next to that auto doc
    Price could increase based on npc's surgery level
    Npc's surgery level should increase slowly over time

    So player right clicks on npc, while standing on an auto doc that the npc owns, and that gives the player the option
        to 'Pay to implant xxxx/yyyy'. Similar to the normal auto doc right click menu, but with a $$$ attached to it



HACKING. THE VIEW I HAVEN'T MADE YET! Need a way to enter into virtual realm


Need a moveObjectFlow or something for asteroids and such I suppose?
    The idea of asteroids flowing in space is cool - but I would have to greatly speed up their movement tick time.

Expand on engine hardpoint stuff
    Make sure ships are slower if they don't have enough engines

Things like energy storage could have a frame for not full, and a frame for full.

A player body type that is resistant to acid - or armor that is especially useful for it. (I LIKE BOTH :p )

    I think it would be neat if there was the option to just take some of what something spawned
    With the Milk Slerm, you could take one or two, and it could generate more, but if you took all,
        it would de-spawn.


Gundam style spaceship for players



Have something like a geothermal well that can be put on any planet - and produces stored energy (batteries?)
    But universally decreases the HP of the planet


Repairman NPC that sits at a spaceport and will buy broken junk off you, repair it, and sell it
    Kind of a side note - but we could have a larger spaceport with more merchant spots for the Azure and Corporation planet
        have lots of space for NPCs and market stalls
        Names for market stalls shown in the client above the spot? "Bob's Repair" for an NPC that repairs named Bob


There's a high fail chance for complex things. Manufacturing skill helps. Certain monsters drop blueprints that will
 99% the success rate of manufacturing the item. Not really sure how I would want to implement blueprints. One time use?
 X times use?



Gas giant that you can land on - but need a special body type for
    Can have 'moons' smaller planets around it!!!!!



 Could give asteroids varrying complexity, to make some easier and some harder to mine.


Biogrove planets can be our gaia type planets. Have a tree of life (think of a cooler name) npc spawn and have an AI at the bottom
    level of the planet. Tree of life NPC would follow NPCs on other planets controlling them/things

Quirks for AIs. Like the idea of an AI that gets focused/obsessed on a particular thing. Clockmaker builds clocks.


Maybe have a super attack on a crazy long cooldown. Mob psycho 100, Goku going all out, etc

Could have an artist npc that only produces a couple of art pieces. Could be paintings or a cool neon statue.
    No effect other than being limited. Decorate captains quarters, sign of power.

Rare items with a limited number that can exist in the galaxy at any given time. Think Star Darts

Piracy/Bounty system
    Could have identity documents that get used when visiting a spaceport. Otherwise spaceport interations would have
        a record of you being there that a mercenary could obtain.

    If a player attacks things on a corporation planet, the CEO puts a bounty on the player's head

    Players could put bounties on other players. NPCs could put bounties on players.

Objects that get better with age. Kind of like wine. Kids were watching a show and they ate 1,000 year old eggs.

Eventually want to make water something more than... nothing. Tail instead of legs on a body if you wanted

Flesh planet type. The whole planet is a massive organism. Pinks an flesh colors

Super polluted planet. Needs drugs to stay healthy. Snow.

Researching system is pretty basic. Wouldn't be a bad idea to expand on it.

Body switching skill. Have a negative effect after switching bodies that people slowly get used too.


More work on factions


Could have really high levels of addiction affect the player instead of just the body

Group some npcs into houses. The idea of powerful houses, being from a powerful house. Offers some protection. Could even have different npc houses
    fight each other. Lots of neat lore in children growing up with a lot of power already, and still aiming for even more.

Bringing bugs/diseases onboard ships. To do it really complicated, would need airlokcs, dcontamination chambers, all sorts of stuff
    Could have a plant type that attaches a bug/spore to a player that would activate once on a ship/station

Need a solution for monsters attacking for 0 damage. Probably shouldn't give equal skill to a player attacking
    a big monster, and another player attacking an iron wall.

Black Cubes with a double helix gold crown on top. COuld be the first Nulrom. Judge. Could spawn on Inferno planets like Slagcell for now.
    Not sure Nulroms should auto attack

For Voonmilk, should have a Matriarch Voon.

Abilities for weapons. So far one of the common things that makes combat in MMOs a little more interesting, is the spells/abilities
    attached to weapons. We could test doing something similar. Give a user something to manage during combat.

    Some abilities could wear down an item.

    Hull welder: turn up the heat or something. Knife, hard stab. Mimetic arm, a pierce.

Thought-Virus. In golden age, something you could buy to permanently alter your thoughts. Always happy, but it's not real happiness.

Armor white as ice

Crystal vein/river deep in the mountain worlds

Avrana Kern ends up being a vindictive AI. Always enough processing power to put down someone. Showing their dead body location when she analyses their plan and sees its faults.

Mercenary/fighter type npc that levels up and goes after bounties

Switching space battles to object attack object. Need to make sure that the ships's coord id is changed when the player
    moves their ship, and battle linkers in galaxy are added as object v object

Energy shapes living in the north poloar magnetospher of the sun. From the book The Golden Age

Neptunian guys in large ice armor to keep their super modified brains near absolute zero.
    It was neat how they communicated. With the extra brain speed/power they attach appendixes to everything. The word I has an appendix that contains
        his whole life.

We want things like a race attacking another race. But inevitably, someone will win/destroy the other. So have some base
    level triggers that we can modify to shift balances

Could have temporary bodies. Ephemeral, transient bodies that are built just to do something really well, for a short amount of time.
    Could purchase from NPCs, or even make them.


Implementing the market linkers, the bidding linkers, etc.
    Gotta get merchant npcs bidding on these things too


Living wood spaceships

Ringworld style planet type - rectangular, not super deep.



Allow a player to rent out tiles that they own. So Cadian can build a building on the azure planet, and rent out rooms.
    Players could bid on the rooms - highest bidder gets it. Probably would make sense to grandfather in the price/month
    that rooms go for. 5th of every ACTUAL human month.
    Would require that planet_coords have a.... owner_room_id and a renting_player_id ? Owner would create a room/space to rent,
    name it, etc.
    Things I think I need for the tables:
        planet_coords:
            area_id
        areas:
            id
            name
            owner_id
            description
            renting_player_id
            rent
        bidding_linkers: ( would be fun for this to work like Ebay. The price is like 5 credits/month higher than the 2nd highest bid )
            area_id
            max_price


Try to have two visuals for the walls - one specifically if there is a wall under it
    Could test with ship walls pretty easily.

    CURRENTLY SEMI-TESTED. HAVE TODO IN client_functions_dev.php in mapAddObjectType


Could add hacking via inserting hidden virus rules into objects

#really not sure I want to code this :p
For cosmetic objects vs functional ones, one day we could have the cosmetics displaying normally,
    and the functional ones when the player goes into combat. Think a nano mesh smart armor that instantly surrounds
    the player, or is normally see through or whatever


When a player interacts with an NPC, it can modify their relationship linker with that NPC. Having a really good
    relationship with an NPC could let you have them join your ship




Eventually it would be neat to have the slaves on Slaver planet actually doing something. Harvesting something. Would actually collect it, and have the slaver masters
    come by and take it

Self propgating deleters or self populatin corruptors. Could have machine worlds fight back with events like these
    when someone establishes an AI on them

Planets should have weather. Rain. Snow. Desert Storms. Effects should be light and nice, so that players don't just disable them. Meteors fallings. Taullerian fragments could
    show up. Idea behind it is waking up in Stardew valley and things have changed. It makes the world feel alive.
    More insects and other little things that show up sometimes on planets. Snails, butterflies, etc

Flesh style planet. The whole planet is a massive organism. Pinks and flesh colors. Gooey.

Ocean of nanobots. Nanobots producing waste heat/steam

Waste disposal on corporation planets

Could have different npc densities based on the planet type. Lots of npcs on corporation planets. Maybe quite a few
multi level buildings with different corporations, CEOs, and guards. Have a CEO npc that spawns a
building and guards and some treasure. Have player take it out

Event that spawns seeds that grow into monsters that spawn other seeds -> monsters. A planetary scale infection

Potentially have a research result window. Would show the result of the research instead of a message that it failed. Could be turned off.

Could have a nanobot collection point like the thiol geyser. Nanobots keeping the planet ecology stable. Or could be an event. Instead of a normal
    dust storm, a nanobot storm to put the planet tile back

Machines that replicate and build more machines. I know I put this somewhere before. Invasion.
    Could have an organic system do this too

Semi transparent creatures. Slug with brain showing

Ships being able to protect other ships

Space sentries. Objects that protect an area of space

On the idea of Biogrove planets or others changing if they are conquered - we could also  use that flag to spawn an Atkins type
    savior for them

Energy shapes living on the sun.

Heat or ice resistant body or armor type

Super polluted planet. Could maybe tie into Corporation planets, and have NPCs using most of their money for drugs just to stay alive.
    Could have an NPC corp that manufacturs the medicine and gets rich off of it.

We should be able to get the ranged attack thing to follow the player. We should be able to base it off of the phaser example
    and have it disappear once it gets to the player. At least have some homing options.

Would be really neat to have a medical NPC that would let you use their
    advanced auto doc for a price. ECONOMY!!!!!!! I could potentially add that in via rules. Would maybe need to add a cost to certain rules. Auto doc has a rule
    that allows all players to use it, but at a cost of 100 credits.

Elevators for quick vertical movement in tall buildings.

The game could have broken derelict ships that spawn with a monster or two inside, and spawn all damaged
    Hell, we could do the same thing with a space station and since it's dockable, the player could explore it
    Seems logical that we would let the player explore the ship before trying to claim it
        Our code really doesn't support that yet.

More advanced types of ships could have floors (materials that they are made of) that have a higher complexity, and are harder to repair.
    Mechanic NPCs

General ship attack/defense

Quasar/Black Hole

Power Knife



Curiosity as an aspect of certain NPCs, monsters, races, AIs, etc

Bioluminescent plants. Glowing underground

Organic ships. Like flying int he mouth of a whale. A modified one with an exoskeleton and plants growing inside for the air.

POTENTIAL HACKING TYPE:
    Go to attack an AI. Slowly adds more and more, stronger and stronger constructs. You can jump to a different spot in... memory? to avoid,
        but that uses some of your energy from your hacking skill, and now you have less left. More advanced AIs find you faster. AI could search each
        square in the location the player jumps to. As you jump you run out of energy. AI closing in, taking you out.


Science vessel could come with an advanced research station or two. Something that you would otherwise have trouble manufacturing at a low level.

Ecology! Things like eggs needing certain conditions to hatch. grows_into_xxxx but with a condition. Needs something to activate.

*ACTUALLY - For now lets not mess with this. I know I keep coming back to it, but not sure I love the implementation.
*For safe spots in space, not sure if I want an entirely different floor type, or I could just color the floor type differently (tint/hue shift/whatever)
*    For the object type giving off this protection area - we would want it to be pretty obvious. An object type where the only rule type is to protect
*    everyone.

I like the idea of information that can be lost, or is particularly hard to obtain. Just not really sure how to implement thing in the world, since
    high tech means that most information is freely available. Possible things would be an advanced type of information that codes itself to the
    DNA of the host. Almost like a virus-thought, but with some neat benefit. If the body dies, so does it. To get this knowledge you would either
    need to obtain it yourself, or buy a body that contains it.

Attacking Overhaul

    Range and Melee for monsters. One large issue is that for melee, the monster would need to be able to get close to the player
    Need to think of an figure out range and melee for monsters

    Maybe some neat way of crafting viruses to attack MLM things

    Damage Types:
        Thought Virus

    Separate attacks out into each thing equipped - for players, npcs, and objects

    For ships, have multiple lasers each show up - and for the defense, need multiple shields to absorb the impact.
        The idea is to have a bunch of lasers firing from different points on the ship, and a bunch of little shield icons.

Could have monsters that are mostly invisible until they attack. Could tie into attack animations.

Unique planet types. First one would be a Slaver Homeworld. Gold.

Odd shaped space stations. Hourglasses, Gold palaces, etc. Would be a neat thing to tie into monetization.

Doctor npc that charges for equips.

Replicating machines. Could have the machine world do stuff like that sometimes.

Server bot. Lady legs. Sexy. Just a try above them. NPC or monster? Servant style NPC

Need some negative effect when switching bodies a lot. Negative effect will slowly decrease as the body switching level increases

Having a pirate engine in your mind, hacking shared throughts. Looking for loopholes.

Helping biogrove planets. Hurting biogrove planets via AI dust and stuff. The idea that Biogrove planets, and the things
    that make them up, are at conflict with AI type things.

Feeding/helping one thing, and having a big effect because a bunch of seemingly unconnected things, are connected.
    Most common version of this is like watering a flower, and all the flowers in the area grow.


There's a group of very peaceful AIs. Players that are not confrontational, don't like the rat race, can have an AI protect them from other players.
But there are heavy conditions for it. They can't have attacked someone else. They can remove the AI protection, but it results in their stats and level
being reduced to when they got the protection. A life bond with a powerful, peaceful AI.




***************** UNSORTED IDEAS ****************************************************************************

backpacks - I really like the different colored backpacks from Tibia. For the inventory, we could have
    backbacks open new windows like in Tibia

We could do a similar things for the different tabs for equipment/management/etc. Make those buttons
    that view/hide divs in the side that the user can open/close.
    Would be neat to let users re-size them - but really not sure about how to do that.

Spider silk seque ship material. Ship material that can be manipulated, changed.

Worms that make silk. Or a metal silk. Feed them and they produce valuable material. Farm the worms.

On corporation worlds, have a life force extractor npc that players can go to. Get paid credits for giving
    some of their life force to the NPC.
    Players would also be able to build these machines/stations.

Npc auto doc

Different bullet types - or at least different gun types. Explode on impact, area of effect type stuff.

Small homing discs that chop off bits
Small homing discs that are timed bombs

Energy shields

Just in general - use more variety in shapes. Circles, squares, rectangles, discs, triangles, etc.
    Look up 'shapes'

Mechs on machine worlds

Monsters that eat things to get stronger. Think demons or something. Could take a baby/weak version of that
    to a planet you don't like - feed it things - maybe even npcs - and make it stronger.

Slave npcs in corporations. Those types of corps would like you if you bring them a body to enslave.
    Could have the same idea with shady corporations that use life force. Give them a body to extract all the force
        out of them


Neutronium

Power a nervous system from a heart like a black hole

Energy Baton

Matrix. Slaves. Promised neverland. Slave farm implementation.

Have things spawn underground that can be salvaged. Have derelict space ships and satellites in space that can be salvaged.
    Could have some that 'crash' and are salvagable on the surface too.

Radiation weapons with area of effect. Could potentially radiate a floor tile for some amount of time.


Pickled food - we could have artisan food types

Storm generator


Have npcs from different races. An MLM npc that wants to gain CPU power, gets stronger as a result. Improves MLM standing.



NPC likes and dislikes. Favorite food or something


Need to disallow is_stairs and is_hole on ship

The idea of allowing players to advance different bugs. Add intelligence to one. Think of uplifting.

The idea of things like water. A river. it's something that can be worked with, modified, re routed. But the system
    itself can't be stopped. It's too large.

Could have a bug race take over a planet. Would require players to get the planet back. They could even show up
    in a spaceship and slowly move towards a planet. Massive bug colony infestation.
    One of the ways we could get this to work is that the colony wouldn't replenish. For an easy one.
    Add things like larva nests and other things so the bugs can spread for a more difficult infestation.

We need some balancing mechanic that lets different races ebb and flow. Can't have bugs take over everything. We could
    have spawn rates increase or decrease based on the number of planets they have. Have savior type events when
    the race's planets are few or none.

Poisoned food. Giving someone poisoned food.


Electricity-based organisms


We could have bodies that are unequipped slowly decay. Players could build healing tiles to counteract this effect
So you switch bodies, the old one being on a healing tile you've built - and it stays fine

No non admin building or replacing floors on azure planets. Gotta test all this
    Might want to make it rule based. (So the AI's rules)
    Same thing with destroying. Allow harvesting, but not destroying
    So to get wood from a tree on an azure planet you would need to harvest a seed and plant it elsewhere


??? Matter Converter (how about to start it just converts shit to credits?)

Need some more active healing things. Sci fi version of potions.



Equipping a pan or something to increase cooking skill. Could have a whole body just for cooking up things
    Eyes that see the temperature of things. Many hands

Viruses that consume crops. Eventually mutate.

Weeds that grow and spread.

Algae to energy conversion. Drew an algae cube



Would be neat to have different bodies have different healing rates and base HP values. Rock would heal slowly but have more initial HP.
    Humans and MLM would heal pretty fast. MLM probably faster. On this point, need to change the player's current hp when they switch bodies

Could have body types that have different limitations. Maybe a body type that isn't hurt by fire tiles, or a body type that
    can't go a normal planet. Not sure this would be the most fun distinction to code in. The idea is having a body
    that is adapt in Space. People growing in 0 gravity would be longer, elegant and willowy.







Would be neat to maybe have a kind of stasis that a body could be put into. Healing tile + some sort of extractor for energy.
    A living battery. I generally like the idea of having a clone/slave
    So we made a life extractor - converting hp to money on corporation worlds. I guess for this we need a
        healing floor + stasis extractor that converts hp to energy, and some way of getting that energy out?

Add crashed Meteorite events and processing finds.

Monsters should be able to grow into other monsters over time (Carnivorous Plant Baby -> Carnivorous Plant)

We are switching player energy to body energy. Did that in some places, but I know there are more places we should do that




To facilitate the alpha, admins should be able to place beacons on planets that they are ready to re-generate. The beacon should give
    players a week to kill it. If it's not killed, the reset will happen. Might work well to keep progress moving forward, but
    give players some flexibility

Would be neat to have monsters able to spawn other monsters. This,
combined with monsters growing, could really let a plague loose on a planet

With addictions and switching bodies, we could have effects pass onto the player themselves if things get bad enough
    Additions could start with the body, but a high level one will impact the player as well.
    There should be some effects from switching a body too much as well. Lose a sense of self, or even just
    a timer for having some negatives to attack and defense.

Suns. I would want the tiles around the sun to to damage over time. A sufficiently strong shielded ship or station
    could live in this damaging area.

Nebulae in space (and other things of this type). Would make it more interesting

Photovoltaic plants for energy generation

Decide if we want to do weapon accuracy in addition to the distance mechanic we have.
    Positives is that it adds another level of competency
    Downsides is it's a layer of complexity
    I sort of enjoy the idea of having someone equip a super complex weapon and hurting themselves - but IDK if that
    would be fun/work.

Thinking that hacking would be more of an end game thing. AIs would be really quick and good at it. Could start with
    just letting a player stand next to a terminal or a large chair, and once they move to the next screen, the AI kills them.

We could have an augment type that get more powerful the longer you are in a specific body. Would reset when you move
    to a different body. Might be useful on Cadian too.

Skin black like space with stars and planets embroidered on it

Admin commands. Maybe /admin-place object_type object_type_id coord_type coord_id
    Or something like that *shrugs*

Need to add skill to manufacturing things. Same with auto docs. Same with research. Failure % chance for harder stuff. Need to make
    sure we increase skills, and that players get better over time. We could either just use the skill, or we could
    have more advanced manufacturers/auto docs/research stations. Probably should start out with just skill based.




I think that a mobile healing station is a neat idea. Potentially let players equip stuff that would heal players next to them,
    or maybe have a deployable nano-med field that would heal in a certain area.

Rat farmer on corporation worlds


Have Cadian energy tick always

Giant worms that dig through just about anything, then go back to the surface, scrunch up, and launch the shit out of massive boulders at distant planets

Have ships able to bet set on some sort of autopilot - use this as a way to move large things like stations over huge amounts of time
    Also lets us make space more distant

Maybe have a thievery skill/points. Could either have it build up points and decay over time
    (and have AIs not allow thieves on their planets potentially) Or we could make it a skill. I kind of like the idea
    of it decaying over time. Potentially have unmonitored areas, where hostile acts aren't seen


Could potentially have planet events based on ownership. Machine planets that are owned by a player could spawn a nanobot swarm that attempts to take the planet back

Biogrove planets could get really angry/strange when their world tree is destroyed, and it tries to grow another one


Should be able to do an injection that increases manufacturing/research/food processing skills but for a very high addiction chance and penalty.
    Think of burning through a body's brain to make it operate at 200% for a bit of time.
    Should also have augments for these types of things


Allow drop linkers (death linkers) to do things like spread an infection.


Let players extract/convert their body energy for batteries and such


Take our player relationship linker and expand its functionality to have scenarios where players can access things based
    on whether the race likes them. The first, most obvious example of races that wouldn't like each other would be MLM and
    Vueg

     Slagcells just like devestation

Could stagger monster and object animation times based on their ID/index or something.



Slaves on the slaver planet should be NPCs that could be liberated. Have a job of mining iron depoists, and actually have them interact with the iron deposists

Have more asteroids with more complexities. more mineral types, harder to mine

Currently we have functions:
    calculatePlayerAttack
    calculatePlayerDefense
    calculatePlayerStats

    All of which do different things. Player attack depends on range. Defense will depend on a bunch of stuff too,
    so maybe we change calculatePlayerStats to calculatePlayerHp or something like that?



Let player add rules to defense drones
Prevent dropping within one tile of spaceport. We are using the can_build_on flag - need a tile type surrounding the spaceport
Prevent monsters from moving on walls and the player (This might be an underground only problem. Check planet level)

implement AOE effects. bombs!

deprecate world.addObjectToPlanetCoord in favorite of main.updateCoordGeneric

bonuses and negatives for different body types



I think the little pod before the player glitch is the coord receiving the player's ship object before the player moves
    Need to think of conditions when we draw the pod. Should we just not draw the ship at all if it's the player's ship id?
    Since we are drawing the player.

Crystal spiders attacking with their fangs, or their legs. Depending on the attack, there's a possibility for more damage
    relate it to the actual monster type

salvage skill - salvaging things spawn on planets, - maybe derelict ships in space that you walk on too
    salvaged materials could be based on what it takes to assemble that object. Uses the object's complexity.
    Maximum amount players should be able to salvage is 1/2.
    e.g. 10 batteries. Max salvage is 5 batteries. Need to beat complexity check by 5 to get all of that. Otherwise you get
        the difference between the complexity check and your level
    Salvaging needs to take longer than attacking the object


I want to play around with the idea of having a view attached to the socket/player. Checking coord id's, ship_coord_ids, etc is kind of a pain


Ship laser should use energy. Ship railgun should use syntite. Let players place batteries into the energy storage object type
    Should always take more energy to attack than to defend. Attacking with laser is more expensive energy wise than defending with shield

    There needs to be some gain from multiple shield generators. Maybe each shield generator takes some time to effectively neutralize
        incoming damage.

    So a minimum ship shield for defense would require a shield generator, energy storage, and the player to have seeded the energy storage with batteries

Need to send new monster hp to the room
Need to show battle effects from other players


More body options - and check to see that body effects happen


Need a way to convert body energy/hp to batteries. Or just let players do that with a lot of algae

Could have a metal associated with the Taullerans. Virtalite, Virtualite, Virite.

RADIATION!!!!!! Damage Type Too. Monster types could either be really sensitive to it, very strong to it, or it could
    actually make them more powerful.
    Radiation meds

We can have slerm live in water based ships - like the octopuses in the children of ruin but - slerm!
    Spaceships full of water. Octopuses.

Add in an airlock type of tile for ships

Ai daemons should decay over time
TOO MANY KICK PLANTS

Separating out planets more would definitely be good
    Spaceports could be larger and have portals on them leading to nearby planets - at least for some beginning planets.
    Not quite sure how to make that all work, and not have Cadian just own all the planets

    We could have NPCs that keep a basic portal system running

Airlocks on spaceships

we have an enslaved_to_player_id on npcs.
    I kind of want the slaver to go around to other places, and enslave npcs. He would probably need to be an npc to do that.
        npcs do need races. npcs would need an enslaved_by_npc_id. I don't generally think that we would want all that
        kind of stuff added to monsters. Being able to enslave. idk.

We could do works_for_player_id for when players offer npcs jobs



Could have multiple tiers of storage objects, manufacturers, etc.
    Higher level ones could have rules attached to them. Smart Crate or something. So the default is just effectively a box.
    More advanced ones could have security levels that people can try and work through, if they are bad people.



How to put a desert storm effect on a tile
    Add effect_id to a planet coord?


There are two scenarios that I would like to have when converting things.
1. Batteries -> Energy. Always. Easy
2. For the Crashed Meteorite I would like to have different possible outcomes.
    So just have multiple conversion linkers with the same input - and then different outputs with different chances

crabs on shallow water tiles
deep water tiles

crystal carapace

Increasing a player -> NPC relationship to possibly get them to work for you.
Drugging the NPC and forcing them to work for you.
Draw injection
    Need to make some items that you equip get used up. Parasites, injections, logic bombs, ACTUAL bombs

Could potentially have something like an injection gun too. Converting/healing via a substance to fill charges


Keep messing with 3.17+ and see if a version that shows up on phones is viable


Lets see if we can combine give with something else. trade? Not sure we really use trade
But we will have players giving and trading things with npcs, as well as other players
I kind of thing that it should probably all go into a trade system, but with one side just being empty for 'giving'.
    LOOK INTO IT!

Chance for enslaving should go up when HP is small. (POKEBALL :p)
Ways of making a slave:
    Mind hacking for machines
Parasite for organics

Add a merchant npc spot in the spaceport. We want a cook npc type that turns basics into food, and sells at a price.
    Would need to acquire items from a merchant or get them


WHEN WE ARE A SHIP THAT IS DOCKABLE, AND WE MOVE, WE NEED OUR UPDATED LOCATION SENT TO PLAYERS DOCKED ON US (PRETTY SURE WE STILL NEED TO DO THIS)
    movement.moveGalaxy at bottom


Research the forge and the manufacturer to get access to the next levels of them - which should allow you to queue up things to build,
    as well as giving a slight bonus.
    Could even have different types of high level manufacturers/forges. Ones that are slow, but give an increase to the skill,
    and ones that are simply faster, or let you queue things up.

SALVAGE
    Makes sense that someone who looks at something and doesn't know what it is, wouldn't be able to find much.
    So makes sense that we could have more of things, and/or more advanced things at higher salvage levels

    create table salvage_linkers(id int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key, object_type_id int,
        salvaged_object_type_id int, salvaged_amount int, complexity int, rarity int, created_at datetime, updated_at datetime);

    Goal is to spawn a derelict, damaged alien ship via an event. Uses at least exodium for it's structure - so a low level can't do
        anymore more than try and salvage it. Maybe with enough salvaged ones, a player could repair it.

    Space Debris (need a better name - broken satellites and things) - add in some basic salvage linkers


Area of effect stuff - really want safe areas in space as we make space larger

SAFE ZONE BEACONS IN SPACE



Some kind of label or tint thing for crates and other things that hold other things


Cooking body - octopus with lots of legs
Manufacturing body - scientist



Take a page out of nature and have ecosystems where multiple things rely on each other.


Slerm armor that's good against corrosive stuff

Radiation knife. Need to come up with a radiation material

Genetweak
Redreed. A smoked substance.

Eventually we need something like a cloning vat to be only able to fit one body at a time. Don't really want 100x bodies in a cloning vat,
    or in a crate or something.

        Got me thinking about space issues. Maybe down the road have a cloning vat put the finished body in a tile around it or something?
            output_placement_locations ? (inventory, tiles_around ). Idk.


Attempt to see if we can have a couple of wall sizes - one for when there is a wall under it.
    I would want to time drawing the tile before and after the extra lookup


Really need to give players more body options. Insect like one. Lizard like one. (INSPIRED DAVID)

Stims that do a higher attack and defense increase, but subtract HP
Nanobot patch that heals large amounts of hp at a time

Would be neat to have a nanobot cloud with a visible effect. Dual purpose healing + blocking some of the damage

Organics that rely on machines to move.
Could do slerm in a treaded cart

eevberry

Have a more advanced type of chitin armor that is chitin combined with something else more difficult to find

Could have an admin page that pushed generic settings to the server. npcs_active true/false (making this secure would need some sort of private key)


On the slaver planet, integrate the idea we had for convict planets. We could have a ruling NPC. Prometheus/Emperor style npc that rules over
    things. The event on the slaver/convict planet could be that their lords go around collecting money from the slaves/convicts.
    Would be neat for NPCs to have lineage. Offspring. Powerful NPC houses/guilds. Would be able to control a planet themselves.
    Empress/CEO/etc. High end NPCs should have guards, their own rooms. Thing stronghold, placace, tower.
    Eventually would be really neat for them to have friends/foes.

    Eventually have NPCs kidnap, mutate, enslave other NPCs



For the Taullerans, think bubbles.

Allow players to expand their ships? Allow ships to have multiple levels?

Shields

I thought it was neat that Polity agents needed a drug to keep their security clearance up. Not sure I would want to
    implement something like that, but you could use it as a way to give temporary passes to players in certain areas.
    E.g. an exclusive space station and this dose gives you access to it for an hour. Or even base a whole faction on the drug.


Players should naturally discover how to build a next level body as part of the beginning steps. Blueprint?

Slerm bodies

Multiple auto attack types on objects. Auto attack objects (player built), Auto attack players
    (or just add in the attacking player objects into the existing stuff )

shipyards, abandoned pods, etc - need to decay at some rate.
For the shipyard, the decay condition would be if it's not active, and has a coord_id.
For the pod, it would be that it is abandoned (no player id)


Potentially have control over slaves wane with time if they don't see you, or you don't re-up their control stuff.


I wonder if I want to start implementing some more sort of economy. Nothing crazy, maybe NPCs needing food, and a
    merchant type NPC to travel around selling food. Merchant, farmer, mercenary. Should be lots of job types,
    but everything players should be able to do much better.

Hestra seeds


For cosmetics....
    Having a cosmetic body makes a lot of sense - nanobots that instantly conform to the situation.
    Not sure about how to do this with ships. For ships.... skins... makes more sense, but that would be
        much more situational
    cosmetic_body_id
    cosmetic_ship_id
    body_skin_id?
    ship_skin_id?


If a monster moves on stairs/hole, it should move up/down

A slave controller
Lamashtu
Lilith
Haldane

Micrometeroroid defenses
Electrostatic radiation deflector
Mechanocytes

Plasmonic
Nueral core
Soul chip
Machines having a system to rebuild. In 'Bit Rot' by CHarles Stross, the machines want pure matrials after a cosmic ray
    encounter to help heal. Primitive functions first. So the highly damaged have no concience.
    In terms of a gameplay element - could have very strong and hostile monster or npc that actually turns logical
        if they receive enough machine material to fix themselves.

I really want the slaves on slaver planets to salvage stuff. Need the damn slaver to head to a corporation planet, abduct a npc (ideally a junkie),
    and have it head back to the slaver planet and salvage falling stuff.
    Could potentially combine the slaver planet with the high wealth/trash city underneath planet stuff

Deep net

Subdermal systems with a rebooting process. Active for like a minute, takes much longer time to reboot

Molecular machines]]Synthbio repair organisms
Stealth fog/blinding cloud. Lowering accuracy

Potentially let players require a fee to land on their planet


    I think I want to keep on expanding out NPCs - I like the idea of a mind control monster spawning on slaver planets,
        the slaver npc harvesting some of that, and then going to the corporation world to enslave someone with the items equipped

        We have the 'control' damage type

        When NPCs are low on health they should try and run to a spaceport, and eat there, or then try to head to an azure planet and heal up there.

        It might be easier for me as a player to initially try the enslaving steps, and just build it out so it works if an npc is doing it too

    Make sure npc maggot farmers are are spawning on corporation planets
        and unfulfilled ones are turning into junkies


    How about a maggot farmer with no goal - happy to just do his maggot farming stuff
    But a maggot farmer with a goal job, will slowly get sad about not fulfilling that goal.
        Maggot farmer that isn't selling any maggots will eventually use a local life force extractor to get a payment, and
            that leaves a chance of getting addicted to it.

        Player should be able to get addicted to them too

    make slavers an npc that flies to corporation planets, enslaves junkies, and brings them back to slaver planet

    We want to also be able to ask npcs to work for us


Thinking dust
Diamond brain
Crystal brain

A trapped god
Synthbio nanodoc

Multipurpose cannon
Diamond Ship
Quark-gluon plasma missle
Microton AM warheads

Could have a monster looking portal as an event. Basically make a portal, but it looks like a huge monster mouth. Transports you to 'inside the monster' (Could just be a ship in the code )

Could have a player body that changes over time.
    Could do this with Ruel bodies - over time they slowly crystalize.
    Could have other body types that just evolve over time.

Spacetime foam
Engineer-of-souls
Diamond sphere eating matter and energy from the sun itself

Supercritical fluid

Planet so hot the rocks melt, evaporate, and rain down

Planet that is frozen for a long period of time, then thaws. The things on it are adapted to hibernate/dehydrate for many years at a time

Star drive - partial dyson sphere around a sun, directing the output
Monsters that get stronger with each battle

Light saber tech. High temperature ionized plasma in a magnetic bottle. Project the plasma + magnetic field to throw a plasma bolt. Plasma torpedo. Plasma spike.

Ships cloaking. Defense drones that attack monsters ( just need to add a rule I think ) and monsters that attack objects

I like the idea of void power

Metaviral spawn

I really do love the scale and scope of the great ship series by Robert Reed. A ship larger than most planets. Unused rocket nozzles so large
    that whole cities can live on them. Alien goo building an entire ecosystem around one.
    I would like some event with a great ship. I am even kind of considering having it show up, fly around space a little, and then leave space for a bit.
        I don't want to trap players. I guess I could add in a warning, even account level that the great ship was going to leave our area of space in
        like a few days ( real time )

    Another one of the issues with this, is there should really only ever be one of these things, but I would probably want to change it
        eventually. I would need some sort of way to update the layout of an existing object (ship) based on new ship linkers


So players and NPCs should be able to bid on the merchant spots in spaceports.
    Players can put in vending machines, or auto docs
    So players should be able to sell their auto doc services for a price.


The idea of having a gaian as a friend. Makes organic things for its friend

Creature that gathers energy and resources as water moves past it.

Finding a quarter in a river. Same idea as breath of the wild. Finding things everywhere. Hide surprises all over the worlds.

A starfaring tree. Metal and junk where you need it for engines, but the rest is a special hard type of wood that grows and
fixes itself. I would want to integrate this somehow with the biogrove planet, or the things on it.

Queen caterpillar

Start off the create ship as a small space with tough walls sealing off other areas. Did that part.
    Now I need to spawn it, and code in the ability to modify it based on new linkers.
    I could link the asteroids moving with now the great ship moves.

The idea that a massive ship or planet gathers mass as it moves through space. Earth size is 45,000 tons/year. So a huge
    ship being built to take advantage of all this extra mass.

    Tritium bomb

Monsters that spawn meat slowly. Regens. Could have something that you harvest/cut on, and takes a bit to regenerate the
    mass. I also want milk slerm to produce slerm milk.

It wouldn't be a bad idea to code in more granular control of generating planets - ability to re-generate a specific level.

I've been thinking of having the pathways be a little more wide by default. 2 squares instead of 1.

Most spaceships and such




right click on your door > manage > add a rule that you can go through it. I'll make it automatically add that rule when they are made.



***************** END UNSORTED IDEAS ************************************************************************




***************** MAYBE IDEAS AND GENERALLY NEAT THOUGHTS ***************************************************

Avengers used a whole star for forging

Multi consciousness. Global. Self was plants, animals, a whole ecosystem feeling and thinkng in different ways

Story of an intelligent virus that in the span of nanoseconds, replicated, realized there was a bigger world out there,
    had a small civilization, made unique art, and language.

Killing other players could stain your soul. Could lose skills to wipe the memory of it.
    In general I don't love the idea of punishing PVP too much. Still think it's an interesting thought


The option of a player being in the game world, but basically being an observer. Followed by an AI that protected the player.
    Restricted from building, hurting other players, and a bunch of other stuff. Would have to lock down things like
    inventory transfer - but then you have issues along the lines of someone using that to safely get monster loot,
    and transferring (even via dropping on the ground) the look to get to a normal player.


************** USED IDEAS THAT WE ARE SAVING FOR WHATEVER REASON *****************


I want two ships with airlocks to be able to move next to each other and interact
    We already get so much of this functionality from 'is_dockable'. So I'm not sure if the solution is to just
    make more ships have the 'is_dockable' flag set to true.
