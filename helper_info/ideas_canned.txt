IDEAS WE DID NOT IMPLEMENT!



Idea:   Being able to talk part of Milk Slerm's spawn, and have Slerm Milk turn into Milk Slerm
Why:    Slerm Milk is an object type, and having it turn into (decay into, or spawn) a Milk Slerm was a larger task than I originally thought. 
            Did an alternate implementation where Milk Slerms sometimes spawn eggs, and those can grow into (spawn) Milk Slerm.
