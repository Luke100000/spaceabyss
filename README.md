# Space Abyss
The full client and server of Space Abyss: https://space.alphacoders.com

Space Abyss is open sourced under the MIT license. The code, the assets, all of it.

Back when I was 13 or so, a kind developer let me buy an old version of his game for $20. 
That started my journey. I hope Space Abyss can help someone else start their journey.

Please check the licenses of any software Space Abyss makes use of ( Phaser, Socket.io, etc ) to make sure
you are in line with all of their licenses as well.


# Technology Used
Client - HTML5 via Phaser 3 ( https://phaser.io )

Server - Nodejs

I'm using Socket.io ( https://socket.io ) to communicate between the two.

# Work In Progress
Space Abyss is in active, early development. For the time being, there isn't going to be an easy 
setup guide; instead I'm just going to be building it. Things like the database can be intuited for now from 
the code, but I know that's a large barrier to understanding/running something. I'll try to clean up and 
prioritize areas that I get the most questions about.


#Structure
The client is in public/dev_client

The server is in dev_server

My current ideas are collected at helper_info/ideas.txt. There are other useful files for world building in there.

# Other Notes
I'm probably doing plenty of things wrong. I tend to learn as I go - and I don't know what I don't know. 
Please try to be kind, and give examples if you're suggesting to do something another way. I may have a 
different idea, but I will always appreciate advice.
